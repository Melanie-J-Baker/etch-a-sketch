A toy to flex DOM manipulation skills. A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using CSS Flexbox. On mouse hover the grid squares change color, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

The squaresâ€™ RGB values are randomized with each interaction.
